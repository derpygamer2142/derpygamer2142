# hi

I'm derpygamer2142, I make stuff and stuff and I like to do the 3d
### Here's some stats:

I work on lots of stuff, not all of it in text based languages. My main project is GPU.sb3 right now, but I might be moving to other technical projects in the future:

I also use scratch and shadertoy, but those aren't on the list.
My username for most things is derpygamer2142, but on Scratch it's insanetaco2000.

## Things I'm working on
Full list [here](https://github.com/users/derpygamer2142/projects/3/views/1), this is just the highlights

- Microsoft Movie Maker in scratch. That's a bunch of sub-projects that I will put together sometime in the future for the final product.
- [GPU.sb3](https://extensions.derpygamer2142.com/docs/gpusb3). A Turbowarp extension for WebGPU compute shaders in scratch.
- [Worldpipe](https://github.com/derpygamer2142/worldpipe). A Websocket server for games designed with [WorldSprites](https://github.com/WorldSprites) in mind.
- [AlarmOpen](https://github.com/derpygamer2142/alarmopen). A **LEGALLY DISTINCT** alarm clock(hopefully some hardware stuff coming soon) that plays **UNCOPYRIGHTED SOUNDS** of your choice.


That's about it, if you went through the effort to read all this you probably need to contact me for some reason.
